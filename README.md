# Harvard Data Science II HW2

## About

The second assignment of the master's level course "BST 261 - Data Science II" at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, taught by Dr. Heather Mattie.

## Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to build a convoluational neural network (CNN) with the purpose of classifying chest x-rays by disease type. This was done via multiple methods: a CNN from scratch, a CNN with data augmentation, using a pre-trained CNN both with and without data augmentation, and attempting to use a GPU via Google Colab.

## Code
